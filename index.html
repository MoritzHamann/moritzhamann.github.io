<p>My name is Moritz (or just Moe) and I am a Software Engineer from Germany, currenlty living in the UK. This page is just a random collection of some of my <a href="blog/index.html">own thoughts</a> on software engineering, or just a way for you to get <a href="public/MoritzHamannCV.pdf">my CV</a> if you really want to.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve studied at the University of Stuttgart and graduated with a Bachelor&#39;s degree in control science, which was followed by a Master&#39;s degree in computer science. During this time I&#39;ve learned quite a bit about a wide range of topics, ranging from control algorithms, embedded computing to machine learning and robotics. In my Bachelor thesis I was working on the control &amp; failure detection system of a real satellite and in my Master thesis I implemented an framework for adaptive compression of scientific simulation data.</p>
<h2 id="current">Current</h2>
<p>I&#39;m currently working for Bloomberg LP, where I&#39;m managing projects in C++, Python and Typescript, as well as learning all about distributed systems and the complex world of finance.</p>

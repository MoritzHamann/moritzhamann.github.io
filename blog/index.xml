&lt;p&gt;&lt;abstract&gt;
In the last days, I got around redoing my site and giving it proper blog.
This was long overdue, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad to finally join the blogging landscape (I
know, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty late to the party :D).
&lt;/abstract&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-site&#34;&gt;New Site&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;m normally just use &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; for most of my simple
Web projects, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to test out a static site generator for the first time.
At &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.deepr.agency&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;deepr&lt;/a&gt;, we already discussed the possibility of a SSG,
at least for some of the simpler web sites of our clients. The clear
advantage would the reduced maintenance overhead for keeping WordPress and the
plugins up to date, and the significantly reduced number of security risks.
Paired with the lack of a database and the thereby simplified deployment process
could make it an worthy competitor for sites, which no or limited dynamic content generation.
However, the lack of a simple user interface for clients and the overhead
of introducing a new technology into the team, prevented the test of an SSG for now.
So I thought my personal blog would be an ideal testbed in order to evaluate the
eligibility of a SSG in my spare time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking over the numerous possibilities listed at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.staticgen.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.staticgen.com/&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://staticsitegenerators.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://staticsitegenerators.net/&lt;/a&gt;, my choice felt more or less randomly on Hugo,
a Go based generator. I did not really have any significant prior experience in Go,
but that did not pose much of a problem in the theme development. The excellent
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/templates/overview/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; on the their homepage
was enough to get the initial theme working in a matter of hours. However, it already
showed that the project is relatively new and some features I got to accept as
standard in WordPress are missing. Mainly, there is no automatic thumbnail generation
or management and no real plugins system in place yet. Especially the last point
is rather restricting, since it requires to either relay on external tools or to
recompile the source, if any special - not build in - functionality is needed. Which
was the case for most projects I have done so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-focus-challenges&#34;&gt;New Focus &amp;amp; Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to shift my focus and give myself new challenges.
Over the course of the last three years, I was working for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.deepr.agency&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;deepr&lt;/a&gt;
as a Web Developer and could witness the evolution of the start up.
What started as a company of only three people, was growing fast into
a successful agency with big and ambitious projects under its belt.
I appreciated my time there, especially because as their first developer on the team,
I had the opportunity to shape the development culture and pick up invaluable lessons
along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after my recent graduation I&amp;rsquo;ve decided it was to time for something new,
and I am trying to pursue a career in machine learning or robotics.
Artificial intelligence was one of the reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve started to study cybernetics
and computer science in the first place, and  - luckily for me - the topic grew heavily in significance
over the last few years, transitioning more and more from research into practical application.
So expect quite a few blog posts on topic here in the future, and if you have
any open opportunities for me in that area, I would be happy if you could drop me a line
via &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:me@moritzhamann.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt; :).&lt;/p&gt;
